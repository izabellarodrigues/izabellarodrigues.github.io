## About Me

Hi! My name is Izabella Rodrigues (they/them) and I am a rising senior at New York University designing an individualized major around environmental design and accessibility. This summer I am working as a CRA-DREU intern at NYU’s Ability Lab and the IDM Audio Lab. I am passionate about accessibility and design and love all things music. 

## About My Mentor

Amy Hurst is an Associate Professor at New York University (NYU) with a joint appointment in the Occupational Therapy Department in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and the Technology, Culture and Society Department in the Tandon School of Engineering. As of 2019, she serves as the Director of the Ability Project, an interdisciplinary research space dedicated to the intersection between disability and technology. Her work primarily focuses on working closely with end users to understand accessibility challenges and the potential for novel assistive technologies to address them. She has been working in accessibility research since 2001, and is currently interested in how we can empower others to “DIY” and build their own assistive technologies through designing accessible tools or training materials for digital fabrication tools.

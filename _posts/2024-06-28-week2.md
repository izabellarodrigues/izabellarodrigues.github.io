CRA-DREU-- Izabella Rodrigues: Week 2
---

I was a little bit slow into figuring out how to do these posts and use GitHub, so I am going to write about I was doing in the past weeks of research. 

Because my advisor was out of town, and because I was egar to start research, I began by reading... a lot. From Mat 20-24th I was beginning to situate my project and contextualize it within other research. 

On Monday May 20 and Tuesday May 21, I built the teenage engineering Pocket Operator Modular 400 Modular Synthesizer with Sequencer and was toying around with all of the modules and patches I could create. I didn't really make anything that awesome but it was such a great opportunity for learning to be able to sit infront of the synth for two days by myself and figure some thigns out. 

On Wednesday May 22, I did some reading and research. 

- I watched "algorave generation",
- read "heavy-lifting"'s website (who is a very talented live coder),
- watched "Making Music with CODE?! (With DJ_Dave and Sam Aaron)" on YouTube which detailed a lot of the differences of differernt live coding tools and platforms,
- read Marianne Teixido on GitHub

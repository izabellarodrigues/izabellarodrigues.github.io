This week we ordered some electronic components for the project and I began designing a tactile module divider on Adobe Illustrator. 

Electronic Components: 
After a bit of research with asking blind musicians and reading about what blind musicians have used in the past we bought both knob potentiometers and slide (linear) potentiometers. The overall feedback was that sliders were preferred but sometimes knobs can allow for a bit more creativity especilly when the knob allows you to rotate it endlessly. 

Lazer Cutter:
I have never used a lazer cutter before so my files have been a bit wonky, but with more practice I think I will get better. 

Additionally, I went to NYC Resistor and checked out their collection of synthesizers and had fun playing with LEDs and solder.

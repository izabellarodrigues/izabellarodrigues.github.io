CRA-DREU-- Izabella Rodrigues: Week 3 
---

This was my first week in person at The Ability Lab at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering. I finally connected with R. Luke Du Bois and got to nerd out at the ITP Audio Lab/ Synth Lab. I feel like we really clicked which was exciting and he was able to offer a different perspective and insite on the project. He gave me resources to reach out to to help the research project go along. I also found that he is quite and important figure in the analogue music, synth, and experimental music world, so just having his name on an email chain can help things move along. The connections that he has are really invaluable.

This week we worked on brainstorming and first steps of our next paper which will be a digital ethnography of novice live coders. I'm learning about data science and cross institution IRBs. 

I attended the "Best Practices for Accessible Presentations" presentation by two PhD students from UW. It was really interesting as this was a big conversation at C&C. I'm not really sure I learned anything new, but glad I could get a refresher. 

The thing I was excited about this week is that we got the LED slide pots and regular slide pots to work on the TE 400 PCB!! It took blowing up a few, startign mini fires, and smelly smoke to make it happen, but we did it. Now it's on to the industrial design portion of the project. Less interesting to me but still cool!

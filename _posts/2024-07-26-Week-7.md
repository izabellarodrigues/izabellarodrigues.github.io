Oh man, this week was crazy! 

1. I attended a switch adapting workshop to learn more about electronics and hacking. 

2. I hung out with a blind friend of mine, Maddy, and we went to Columbia University Teacher's College to check out their tactile map, then went down to Washington Square area to look at the streets, buildings, and traffic patterns there inorder to get more understanding of what a tactile map should include for her, and then went to the Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library to look at braille music and meet with a mobility and orientation specialist. I learned so much about blind navigation that my brain felt like it was going to explode in a good way!

3. I attended a Laser Cutting Training at the NYU MakerSpace.

4. I attended meeting with important stakeholders about a project called SensoriumAI. It is an opera about a nonverbal child with CP and involves really cool technology in speech synthesizers and donated voices from the community.

5. I worked with Willie and Matthew on braille displays and text.management

6. I went to a New Jersey MakerSpace that does a lot with tactile design. I played a lot with their tactile programming language and learned a ton about 3D printing "crispy" braille.

Overall it was an incredible week, but super draining and I spent the weekend in bed :)

TOM Fellow 
This week I flew to Atlanta, GA to start my TOM Fellowship. I got to build todler mobility trainers and talk to all the other fellows about open source accessible technology. 

Georgia Tech (Georgia Institute of Technology) 
I also went to meet with faculty at GT to talk about their research and my research and potentials for growth and collaboration.
